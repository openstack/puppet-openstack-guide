Governance
==========

Puppet OpenStack governance is well defined and `documented`_.
It documents:

* The current Project Team Lead
* The mission statement
* The repositories that are managed by the group


PTL duty
========

While the official OpenStack PTL duty `guide`_ is general, the Puppet
OpenStack PTL is usually in charge of:

* community management by keeping abreast of upcoming meetings
  (summits, OPS meetups) where it would be interesting for our
  community to be represented.
* weekly meeting organization.
* OpenStack Cross-Project liaison.


Core-reviewers team
===================

Puppet OpenStack has a `core-reviewers`_ list, that can merge any code in our
repositories.

We also have sub-groups for puppet-keystone and puppet-neutron (more in the
future) modules with people who can merge code in these repositories.
It allows people who are experts in one OpenStack component and involved in
the Puppet module, to become core, and improve our review quality.


Release team
============

Until Puppet OpenStack releases will be managed by OpenStack Release Team, releases
are now managed by a release `subteam`_.
