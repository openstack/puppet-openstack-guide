In general, the mailing list is preferred, because it makes the
information more readily available so that others who have the same
question can search for and find those answers.

-  Dev discussions and usage discussions:
   `openstack-discuss@lists.openstack.org <http://lists.openstack.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/openstack-discuss>`__
   with ``[puppet]`` tag.
